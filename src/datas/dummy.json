              "overview": "Promotional poster for the Wonhae Hwang – Solo Exhibition titled 'Hydra Square.' The exhibition ran from 2024.7.4-7.21 and explores the mixed and ambiguous senses of urban Non-Places. The artist, Wonhae Hwang, uses opposing images like the 'Hydra' and 'Square' to capture fragmented movement.",
              "colorAndComposition": "Palette: Primarily Monochrome (Black graphics and text on a White background). Contrast: Extreme High Contrast is the foundation, creating visual vibration. EMOTION: Stark, Cold, and Rigorous, emphasizing structure and intellectual difficulty. Principles: Balance is symmetrical in its centralized weight but asymmetrical in its internal detail. Alignment is intentionally broken/mixed in the central type block. Negative Space is substantial in the margins, isolating and emphasizing the dense, visual knot. Composition: Hyper-Dense Layering (Maximalist density).",
              "imagery": "Source: Type-as-Image; the visual content is constructed solely from layered, manipulated typefaces. Obvious Shapes: A dense mixture of modular pixel blocks and curvilinear script outlines forms, all tangled to create the central mass. Mood: Aggressive, Experimental, and Intellectually Complex. It evokes System Failure and Information Overload. Texture/Effects: Dominated by the Digital Decay or Glitch aesthetic. Textures include square pixelation and digital noise, giving a rough, static-like appearance."
